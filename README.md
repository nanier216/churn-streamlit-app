## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is a **Telco Customer Churn Prediction** web application built with **Streamlit** that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn based on their account details. It leverages a machine learning model trained on telco customer data, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for business users to input customer information and get churn predictions instantly.

---

## 🎯 Features

- **Interactive Input Form:** Enter customer details such as tenure, monthly charges, and total charges.
- **Accurate Prediction:** Model predicts the likelihood of customer churn with ~75.76% accuracy.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Displays a friendly message indicating whether the customer is likely to churn.
- **Lightweight & Fast:** Built using Streamlit for rapid deployment and ease of use.
- **Reproducible:** Includes data preprocessing, model training, saving/loading model pipeline.

## 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/churn-streamlit-app.git
cd churn-streamlit-app
````

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

To launch the Streamlit web app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open the app in your default web browser. Input customer details and get instant churn predictions!

---

## 📈 Model Training

To retrain the churn prediction model from scratch and save it:

```bash
python save_model.py
```

This script will train the model on your dataset and save the serialized model to `model/churn_model.pkl`.
